**RAT** stands for **Remote Access Trojan** or **Remote Administration Tool**. This type of tool is one of the most dangerous virus programs. Using RAT, a hacker can take complete control of your computer and do anything with it. Using RAT, a hacker can install a keylogger and other malicious programs on your system and remotely access and infect your system files.

The hacker can use this program to send you image and video files or any other file. If there is an active and up-to-date antivirus on your system, some of these uploaded files will be detected and prevented from infiltrating your system. However, in some cases, there are RATs that are not even detected by the antivirus.
