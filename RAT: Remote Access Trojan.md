**RAT** stands for **Remote Access Trojan** or **Remote Administration Tool**. This type of tool is one of the most terrible security threats for both individuals and organizations. Using RAT, a hacker can take complete control of victimâ€™s computer and do anything with it.

## *What Can a RAT Do?*
RAT is often used by **APT attackers** to gain interactive access to a victim's computer and steal confidential data. Once RAT is installed on the victim's computer system, the hacker can do almost anything with the system. 

Some of these malicious activities are as follows:
  * Monitoring victim's screen.
  * Start and open remote applications such as webcam, music player, etc.
  * Infect system files.
  * Install keyloggers to capture keys entered by the victim.
  * Use system as a zombie system for DDOS attacks.
  

## *Can RATs Be Useful?*
Although most RATs are malicious, there are some useful RATs. Programs like TeamViewer are valuable Rats used to remotely control systems over the Internet and to transfer files and support systems. When there is a technical problem with any of the computers at workplaces, the corporate IT guys may use a RAT to gain access to the computer and resolve the issue.

## *RAT Attack Procedure*
"RAT is a malware program that includes **a back door for administrative control** over the target computer"[[1]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/RAT-remote-access-Trojan). A backdoor is a way to get access to a computer system or encrypted data by circumventing the system's normal security measures. Email attachments, USB memory, and file bundles are all common ways for RAT to get into a system. RATs are typically delivered as an email attachment or downloaded **invisibly** with a user-requested program, such as a game or any other popular application. Once the host system has been infiltrated, the intruder can use it to spread RATs to other computers that are vulnerable, forming a botnet[[1]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/RAT-remote-access-Trojan). 

RATs are often built on the **Client/Server architecture**. The attacker has control over the client, and the server is installed on the victim's PC. To implement remote control for the victim host, the attacker utilizes the client to control the server[[2]](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/11/1894/htm).
